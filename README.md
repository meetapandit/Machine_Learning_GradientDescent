# Machine_Learning_GradientDescent

Objective of this Project is to predict the median price of homes using:

1. Use Linear Regression library to fit a model on Boston data set
2. Implement Gradient Descent to reduce the loss function (error rate)
3. Compare the run time of calculating gradient descent using normalized and not normalized data
4. Compute RMSE and compare to k-NN algorithm to find the best prediction model
